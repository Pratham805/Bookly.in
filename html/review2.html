        About this book , i am very satisfied but the paper printing and paper quality is not good, it's like a xerox paper printing.Overall this book is very good for an engineering examination preparation.. <br>

        7] Useless product (1⭐)
        <br>
        Total waste of money. Question level is too low to ask in important examinations. Half of the questions are previous year ESE before 2k. No illustrative explanation is provided for all questions, and it is available for only handful of questions. Don't buy. Go for previous year ESE by Made easy or IES master.

        9] Absolute rubbish!  (1⭐)
        <br>
        The product wasn't delivered at the address given by me, I was charged 40 rupees for delivery but I have to travel 1.5 kilometres. So I am not satisfied with the delivery. <br>
